## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `master`
2. **Install** development dependencies and set up your environment
3. **Make** your changes and ensure the code compiles successfully
4. **Test** your changes thoroughly on real devices
5. **Update** documentation if you changed APIs
6. **Submit** a pull request with a clear description of changes

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minercontroll.git
cd minercontroll

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature

# Build and test
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew test
```

## Code Style

### Kotlin Guidelines
- Follow [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)

- **What actually happens**
- **Device information** (Android version, device model)
- **Screenshots** if applicable

### Example Bug Report
```markdown
## Bug: Miners not appearing in dashboard

**Environment:**
- Device: Samsung Galaxy S21
- Android: 13
- App Version: 1.0.0

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Connect to WiFi network 192.168.1.x
2. Start MinerControl app  
3. Navigate to dashboard
4. Wait 30 seconds

**Expected:** Miners should appear in the list
**Actual:** Dashboard shows "No miners found"

**Additional Info:**
- Miners are sending UDP packets (verified with Wireshark)

```

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature suggestions! Open an issue with:
- **Clear description** of the feature
- **Use case** explaining why it's needed

## Translations

Help us translate MinerControl to more languages:

1. **Check** existing translations in `app/src/main/kotlin/com/minercontrol/app/utils/LanguageManager.kt`
2. **Add** your language to `AppStrings` sealed class
3. **Translate** all string values
4. **Test** the translation in the app
5. **Submit** pull request

### Translation Guidelines
- Keep **consistent terminology**
- Consider **text length** (UI space constraints)
- Use **native conventions** for numbers and dates
- Test on **different screen sizes**

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- **Test on real devices** when possible
- **Different Android versions** (especially minimum API 24)
- **Various network configurations**
- **Different miner setups**

### Automated Testing
- **Unit tests** for business logic
- **UI tests** for critical user flows
- **Integration tests** for network communication

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests="MinerRepositoryTest"
```

## Code Review Process

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review:

1. **Automated checks** must pass (build, tests, lint)
2. **Manual review** by maintainers
3. **Feedback** addressed and changes requested
4. **Approval** and merge when ready

### Review Criteria
